After changing the div's in the header and footer to "header" and "footer" and adding alts to each image, I inspected the page and used the Lighthouse feature in google chrome to see what I could do to improve SEO more. I added more "meta" info and changed the name of the "title" from website to Horiseon. I also added an ID tag for the first SEO # so that it would jump to that section.
I also changed the sidebar section from a div to aside and in the header changed a div to nav instead and then from there changed the css code to reflect that class as nav instead of the div it originally had.
